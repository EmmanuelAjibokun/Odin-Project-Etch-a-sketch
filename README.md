# Odin-Project-Etch-a-sketch

The aim of this project is to develop a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Hands-on Experience
This project has significantly improved my ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), a critical skill for any frontend developer. And I've gained practical experience with various JavaScript methods and CSS properties, reinforcing theoretical knowledge through application.

## Tools
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript
